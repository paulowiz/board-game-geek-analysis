```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Load the required library
library(httr)
library(dplyr)

# Specify the URL of the API
api_url <- "https://api.music-to-scrape.org"

# Remember, the documentation is available at https://api.music-to-scrape.org/docs!

# From that API, we can pick an endpoint - think of it as a website, but then 
# for computers to read!

# Here, we extract the weekly top 15 songs.

# Send an HTTP GET request to the API

# Introduction

## Background
Provide an overview of your journey in academia and your decision to transition to board game design. Introduce the concept of "Academia: The Board Game" and the main goal of creating a profitable game.

## Objectives
Outline the main objectives of the report:
1. Prepare and describe the data.
2. Analyze the important game design variables.
3. Lay out a strategy recommendation.

# Data Preparation and Description

## Data Source
Describe the BoardGameGeeks data obtained from TidyTuesday. Mention the types of information available (e.g., game ratings, mechanics, themes, user reviews).

## Data Preparation
Detail the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data in R. Include code snippets where appropriate.

## Performance Measures
Discuss two performance measures (e.g., average rating, number of ratings) and their relevance to the goal of making money.

## Key Variables
Identify and describe three to four key variables that could inform game design actions (e.g., mechanics, play time, number of players).

## Control Variables
Identify variables that might affect game performance but are not part of the strategy options (e.g., year published, game category).

## Data Summary
Provide a table and a figure summarizing the frequency and distributions of relevant variables.

# Data Analysis

## Relationships with Performance Measures
Analyze how key design variables relate to performance measures using appropriate statistical methods.

## Model Evaluation
Discuss the appropriateness of the model based on R output. Explore other methods to test the relationships (e.g., ANOVA, correlation analysis).

## Causality Discussion
Examine the potential for causal inference in the dataset. Discuss limitations and assumptions.

## Results Presentation
Provide a single result table and a figure to present the analysis findings.

# Strategy Recommendation
Strategic Insights
Build on the analysis to provide strategic recommendations for the game design.

## Limitations
Discuss the limitations of the analysis and recommendations.

## Additional Data and Analysis
Suggest additional data that could further inform the strategy and potential analyses that could be conducted with it.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and strategic recommendations. Reinforce the goal of creating a successful and profitable board game.
